#+AUTHOR:Nicolas P. Rougier â€” Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest

*Abstract |* This library provides an outer indent mode for org
           headlines that is compatible with org-num-mode.
           
* Introduction

This library provides an outer indent mode for org headlines that
is compatible with org-num-mode. Use =<M-x org-outer-indent-mode>=
to activate it.

** How does it work?

Internally, the library advises the =org-indent--compute-prefixes=
function to compute line prefix depending on the desired mode and
add a hook on org-num-mode to hide/show stars.

** Limitations

- =org-num-mode= can selectively un-number a given headline. In such
  case indentaton will be wrong and stars will be hidden, which might
  be confusing. It might be possible to solve the problem by examining
  org-num-mode overlays but this might be too much work.
 
- When used in conjunction woth org-num-mode, outer indentation works
  if the number of sections at a given level is < 10 and uses a
  regular numbering format (such as the default one).
